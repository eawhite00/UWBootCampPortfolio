# UWBootCampPortfolio
This is my portfolio website created as part of my UW Coding Boot Camp


This is a big-time first draft of my portfolio. I missed the original portfolio assignment, this was me creating my initial portfolio while at the same time trying to polish it up. I nixed the contact page because that wasn't adding any function for me. I'm probably going to rebuild the entire thing using Materialize, but for now here is something that exists for me to turn in.

# Improvement Areas
- Rebuild the entire thing using Materialize?
- Change the font
- Finish updating and add my resume
- Convert to a one-page layout, I think
- Tweak the color scheme
- a lot, honestly, I have so much I want to change here.
